# Django Project Management Application

A backend-focused project management application built with Django.  
It features a complete user authentication system, full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for projects, and a detailed Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.  
The user interface is progressively enhanced with **HTMX** to provide a dynamic, single-page feel for key actions.

## üöÄ Core Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure user sign-up, login, and logout functionality.

- **Project CRUD**  
  Authenticated users can create, view, update, and delete projects based on their assigned permissions.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - **Owner**: Full control over the project, including managing users and deleting the project.
  - **Editor**: Can view and edit project details but cannot delete the project or manage users.
  - **Reader**: Can only view project details and its members.

- **Dynamic UI with HTMX**  
  Key actions like creating projects and managing users are handled via AJAX requests, providing a smooth user experience without full page reloads.

## üß± Technical Stack

### ‚ûï Create a New Project

- Once logged in, you will be on the main projects page.
- Click the **"Create New Project"** button. The form appears dynamically via HTMX.
- Fill in the project details and click **"Save Project"**.
- The project list updates instantly.

### üë• Manage Users in a Project

- Click a project to go to its **Project Detail** page.
- As the **Owner**, you will see a **"Manage Users"** button.
- Click it to open the user management interface.

### ‚ûï Add a Second User as an Editor

- Open an incognito/private browser window and sign up with a new username.

- ‚ùå See the "Manage Users" button  
- ‚ùå See the "Delete Project" button

This confirms that Role-Based Access Control is functioning as intended.
